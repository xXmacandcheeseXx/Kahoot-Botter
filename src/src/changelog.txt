+1.0.0
-it works

+1.0.1
-added: using tabs instead of opening a new instance of chrome every time to increase speed and decrease RAM and CPU usage
-removed: Kahoot Helper Bot (using 1.0.0 with many people can still be fast but not recommended)

+1.0.2
-added: a check to see if the game code exists
-removed: using files to send game information because it no longer uses multiple programs like 1.0.0

+1.0.3
-added: better context in directions
-added: something that tells you when all bots are sent
-added: releases for different operating systems

+1.0.4
-fixed: saying driver directory wasn't there because it was trying to get information from a non-existing file that was used in v1.0.0

+1.0.5
-added: opens all tabs first then it goes back and joins on all of the tabs to speed up the process by A LOT

+1.0.6
-fixed: finally works on mac (still can't find out how to do linux but you can try making it work)

+1.0.7
-added: actually answers questions rather than just doing nothing (it only works on true or false and multiple choice answers but it ignores the other ones)
