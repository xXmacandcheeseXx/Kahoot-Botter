# Operating Systems

I have never tested this on linux or OSX

I will be very appreciative if someone can test it (I know I said I tested on OSX but it never got the bots to send probably because I was using .NET 6.0 instead of .NET Core 3.1)

I might just end up testing on the differnet operating systems on a vm
